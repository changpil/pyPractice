# Shortest Path In 2D Grid With Keys And Doors
# Given a two-dimensional maze represented by a character grid, find the shortest path from start to goal cell.
# You can move vertically or horizontally—but not diagonally—one step at a time.
# There are six types of cells:
# There’s exactly one start and one goal cell. Other cells may appear any number of times.
# Water can never be visited. A door cell can only be visited after visiting a matching key, e.g. key ‘a’ for door ‘A’.
# Other cells can be visited unconditionally. It is allowed to visit a cell more than once.
