A try and except block is used for error handling in Python.

Try: Helps to test the code. If the code inside the try block is error free it is executed. Otherwise the error gets caught and control goes to the except block.
Except: Except displays the error message.
Else: Executes if there is no error in the code in the try block.
Finally: Executes independently of the try-except block results.
The Else and Finally block are optional but it is considered a good programming practice to include them.
